A set of practical tips and mindset guidelines for early-career professionals—especially analysts—on how to thrive at work while maintaining balance and professionalism.




## 1. Working Efficiently

### Print and highlight comments/requests

When you receive comments or a request, print it and highlight each item as you address them.

### Always take notes

Whenever attending meetings or speaking to someone at their desk, never show up empty-handed. Always bring something to write with.

### Note your mistakes

It's okay to make mistakes—just don’t make the same ones repeatedly.

### Come into the office early

Arrive ~15–20 minutes before the start of the day. It builds your reputation for reliability. If you're ever late, people will understand.

### Be careful with volunteering for extra work

Don’t overextend yourself. Focus on delivering great work instead of saying yes to everything.

### In Outlook

- Create project folders on day one to stay organized.
- Archive non-essential items for future reference.
- Flag and file actionable emails.
  - Respond quickly if possible (30–60 seconds rule).
  - Otherwise, set aside time to respond thoughtfully.
- Add new contacts to Outlook to save time later.
- Start and end each day with a clean inbox.
- Use a to-do system—digital or analog—to stay on track.

### Learn keyboard shortcuts

The first time using shortcuts will feel like a waste of time but it will make you quicker in the long run.

```bash
# General Windows shortcuts
Windows + E            # Open Windows Explorer
Windows + (type name)  # Open any application quickly
```

```bash
# PowerPoint/Excel alignment shortcut
Alt + H + G + A + C    # Align center (Excel/PowerPoint)
```

Avoid using the mouse in Excel. Even in PowerPoint, keyboard shortcuts are faster for actions like aligning, changing colors, and adding slides.

### Customize quick access toolbar

- Add frequently used functions in Excel or PowerPoint to the quick-access toolbar.
- Create shortcuts for repetitive multi-step actions.
- Once comfortable, record macros for advanced process automation.

### Own your work

- Know your transaction analysis inside and out.
- Create summary printouts of key outputs and sensitivities for downtime review.
- Be able to answer MD questions clearly and quickly.

### Own your projects

- Always consider:
  - What is the big picture?
  - What are the key insights?
  - How can I make others' lives easier?
- Even if you don’t plan to stay long-term, take ownership as if you do.

## 2. Communicating Effectively

### Be assertive

Keep your seniors updated on everything you’re doing. It helps avoid late-night surprises and shows responsibility.

### Respect everyone's time

Give heads-ups and clarify questions ahead of time. Be concise and intentional.

### Ask what the timing is on any request

Clarify deadlines to help manage priorities and workload expectations.

### Problem and solution

Always bring a proposed solution when raising an issue to a senior.

### Learn to balance asking vs. figuring it out

Use the “30-minute rule.” If you're stuck for more than 30 minutes, ask. Take notes to avoid asking twice.

### Over-communicate

Keep the team updated on progress, blockers, and delivery timelines. Notify proactively if delays occur.

### Be clear

Always clarify the context of your questions. Remind seniors of relevant details when needed.

## 3. Being Professional

### Do not let this job consume you

Work is important, but never at the cost of your mental health.

### Build relationships beyond the office

Make an effort to leave your analyst years with connections that last beyond the role.

## 4. Balancing Work with Personal Life

### Prioritize your health

- **Sleep**: 5 hours isn’t sustainable. Sleep more to function better.
- **Eat in moderation**: Money for food doesn't mean unlimited calories.
- **Exercise**: Aim for 3 workouts/week—one during the week, two on weekends.
  - Walk to work to increase daily steps.

### Don’t neglect relationships

- Make time weekly for the people who matter most.

### Find or continue a hobby

- Don’t abandon personal interests. With effort, hobbies can coexist with a demanding job.
